Setting Up the Arbitrum Environment

To deploy the contract on the Arbitrum Sepolia testnet, I first connected MetaMask to the Arbitrum Sepolia network. This required adding the network details manually in MetaMask, including the RPC URL, chain ID, and currency symbol. Afterward, I ensured I had test ETH by using a Sepolia faucet to fund the account for transactions. Remix IDE was used to write, compile, and deploy the smart contract.

Writing, Compiling, and Deploying the Contract

The contract was a simple smart contract with a message state variable. A constructor was added to initialize the message, and a public function allowed the message to be updated. I wrote the contract in Solidity, ensuring it adhered to best practices, including using the appropriate data locations (memory). After writing the code, I compiled it using the Solidity compiler in Remix and ensured there were no errors. The next step was deployment. Using the Injected Provider - MetaMask environment in Remix, I deployed the contract to the Arbitrum Sepolia testnet, confirming the transaction in MetaMask.

Challenges Faced and Solutions

A key challenge was ensuring compatibility between the deployed contract and the Arbitrum network, especially when configuring the network in MetaMask. To resolve this, I carefully verified the RPC details and ensured the correct chain ID was used. Another issue arose when insufficient gas caused a deployment error. This was solved by manually increasing the gas limit in Remix before deploying. Finally, verifying the contract on Arbiscan required using the exact compiler version and enabling optimization settings matching the deployment.

By following these steps and addressing challenges methodically, I successfully deployed and verified the contract on Arbitrum Sepolia.
